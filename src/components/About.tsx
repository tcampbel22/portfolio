					Software developer with hands-on experience in full-stack development 
					and a strong focus on backend engineering. Before transitioning into tech, 
					I spent over 10 years in hospitality and food-tech operations leading restaurant launches, 
					managing teams, and driving projects in startups, small businesses and larger enterprises.
					Now, I bring that same energy and strategic mindset to software development, with a background 
					in managing people and processes, Iâ€™m a strong communicator, problem-solver, and collaborator. 
					<br/>
					<br/>
					I'm currently building projects with Python, Typescript and Javascript, 
					as well as using frameworks and libraries such as React, Express and FastAPI.
