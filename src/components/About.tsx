					Software developer with hands-on experience in full-stack development 
					and a strong focus on backend engineering. Before transitioning into tech, 
					I spent over 10 years in hospitality and food-tech operations leading launches, 
					managing teams, and driving projects in fast-paced startup environments.
					Now, I bring that same energy and strategic mindset to software development. I'm passionate about 
					backend architecture, API design, and building clean, well-tested applications. 
					<br/>
					<br/>
					My current toolbox 
					includes C, C++, Python, TypeScript, and JavaScript, along with experience in frameworks like React, Fastify, and Flask.
					With a background in managing people and processes, Iâ€™m a strong communicator, problem-solver, and collaborator.
